# Hl7-Peek-
This is a simple C++20 program I made to start learning more about HL7 and healthcare IT/health informatics. It reads an HL7 v2.x message, counts up the segments, and pulls out basics like the patient’s name and date of birth. Nothing too advanced, but it’s a good starting point for me to get more comfortable with C++ and see how this version of HL7 messages are structured.

Honestly took me some time to figure this stuff out. HL7 messages looked pretty confusing at first with all the pipes and segments, but I'm getting the hang of this a little bit, figured it might take time anyway. I'll be moving on to other versions when this project is complete and adding more to this readme.
