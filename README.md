# Hl7-Peek-
This is a simple C++20 program I made to start learning more about HL7 and healthcare IT. It reads an HL7 message, counts up the segments, and pulls out basics like the patient’s name and date of birth. Nothing too advanced, but it’s a good starting point for me to get more comfortable with C++ and see how HL7 messages are structured.
